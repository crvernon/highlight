    By default, only OpenAI's models are supported. You can add support for other providers by installing one ore more of the package's optional dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install ".[anthropic, dartmouth, ollama]"
    ```
    **Note:** Support for models provided by Dartmouth requires Python 3.10 or higher.

### Configuring the LLMs
You can configure a variety of LLMs, both remote and local, to choose from in the app. To do this, edit the file `config.toml` in the root of this repo.

#### Setting Up API Keys
If any of the configured models require an API key, you need to set them up as Streamlit secrets.

First, you have the acquire the API key from the provider of your choice (e.g., [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)).

Then, create a folder named `.streamlit` in the root of this repo. Inside that folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`.

Finally, store your API key(s) in the following format:

```toml
KEY_NAME = "your_api_key_here"
```

Replace `KEY_NAME` with the variable name corresponding to your provider:

| Provider    | Variable name       |
| --------    | -------             |
| Anthropic   | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Dartmouth   | `DARTMOUTH_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI      | `OPENAI_API_KEY`    |


Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.


### Running the App

To run the app using Streamlit, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the Streamlit app from the `highlight` directory:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
